                    <h3>PLANT TREES</h3>
                    <p>Depending on where in the garden you have access, a solution may be to plant trees along the plot’s boundaries. Given the purchase price, transport and planting, in that case it will probably be best to procure small, young trees</p>

                    <h3>CONSTRUCT A HEDGE</h3>
                    <p>A hedge can be a beautiful and constantly growing barrier that is much nicer and more environmentally friendly than, for example, concrete or brick. It can provide effective wind protection, reduce noise coming from outside and can also prevent snow from blowing into the garden during the winter.</p>

                <div>
                    <h3>A LIVING WALL</h3>
                    <p>If the only solution is to build a wall, you have the opportunity to make it alive and green by creating a so-called vertical garden. This will result in a very effective privacy protection which will also be a nice and modern element in your garden. Living walls are a perfect solution for those who have a limited space to grow on. </p>
